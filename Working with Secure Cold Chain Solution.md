## Exercise 4: Shipment Management

**Scenario**

This exercise explains about the shipment management in Cold Chain application

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Shipment Management

### Task 1: Shipment Management

The web application allows the admin to create and manage the shipments. The web application will allow the admin to map the beacons with product, box, carton and pallet that will be used during the transport. After that, the web application will allow the admin to create association between objects which will help while monitoring the sensor data during the transport.  After the association among the objects is created, the admin will have assign gateways and trackers to each pallet. Each of this process will be discussed in this section.

####  Create Shipment

1.	Click on **Shipment tab** under **Admin page**, here you can **create a shipment** and **Associate**.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u39.png)

2.	To create a new **Shipment**, you need to click on the + on the top right corner above the **shipment List**.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u40.png)

3.	Once you click on the **+ symbol**, a popup box opens for you to add the required information about the shipment such as **Shipment ID, Purchase Order, Logistics Partner, Source, Destination** and **list of products**.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u41.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u42.png)

4.	Once you click on **Create button** you will get a popup window **Consignment successfully** added to **Blockchain**.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u43.png)

5.	Once you **created shipment**, click on **refresh** symbol and you can see the **added shipment**.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u44.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u45.png)

**Note**: The next step is to **Map Beacons** to the **object** and assigning **Tracker** and **Gateway** to each of the **pallets** present in the **shipment**.

####    Mapping Beacons to Objects

The web application provides an interface for the admin to map each beacon sensor with an object (ex. Product, Box, Carton, Pallet). These mapping data is required to monitor the sensor data during the transit of the shipment. This mapping will help in monitoring the sensor data at multiple level (Product level, Box Level, Carton Level and Pallet Level).

1.	In the **Shipment** tab click on the **Associate** button shipment.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u46.png)

####    Adding a Mapping

1.	You can see a **green Map button** on the top left corner above the table and a drop-down list below it in the above image. Click on **Map button** you see a new row is added in the table where minimum and maximum threshold values will be automatically populated based on the storage class you have selected. These values are also editable.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u47.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u48.png)

2.	To map a beacon to an object, you need to add the **Beacon Id** of the **Beacon Sensor**, the **Object ID** of the object you want to map the beacon, the type of the Object and the **Content** of the object as below
3.	Once you have filled all the related information, click on the **right green symbol** in the table. This will save the mapping information in the database.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u49.png)

4.	It will open the popup window to add the database.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u50.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u56.png)

####    Create Association among Objects

Once the beacons are mapped with the object, the next step is to create association among the objects. This association will help us in defining hierarchy among the objects in a shipment.

1.	Once you have clicked on the **Next button** after mapping your beacons and objects.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u57.png)

2.	Simply **drag** and **drop** the labels from the **left section** to **right section** of the page. This definition of hierarchy is needed to know till which level we are monitoring the sensor data.

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u58.png)

![alt text](https://github.com/SecureColdChain/Wipro-Ltd-ColdChain/blob/master/Documentation/images/u59.png)
